# Device Placement and Tensor Consistency Fixes

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive fixes implemented to resolve device placement issues and tensor consistency problems in the Neuro Exapt dynamic architecture framework.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Device Mismatch Errors
**Problem**: `Input type (torch.FloatTensor) and weight type (torch.cuda.FloatTensor) should be the same`
- New layers were created without proper device placement
- Policy networks and target networks were not consistently placed on the same device as the base model
- State tensors were created on CPU while model was on GPU

### 2. Tensor Type Inconsistency
**Problem**: Tensors from different sources (CPU vs GPU) were being mixed in operations
- Experience buffer stored tensors on mixed devices
- Model state save/restore didn't handle device consistency
- Policy network updates used tensors from different devices

### 3. Dimension Mismatch Issues
**Problem**: Dynamic layer additions could cause dimension mismatches
- New layers weren't properly initialized with correct dimensions
- Device placement wasn't considered during layer expansion
- Insufficient validation of layer compatibility

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced DynamicArchitecture Class

#### Device Management
```python
class DynamicArchitecture:
    def __init__(self, ..., device: Optional[torch.device] = None):
        # Store device and ensure model is on correct device
        self.device = device or torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
        self.base_model.to(self.device)
        
        # Create policy networks with explicit device specification
        self.policy_net = AttentionPolicyNetwork(..., device=self.device)
        self.target_net = AttentionPolicyNetwork(..., device=self.device)
```

#### State Tensor Consistency
```python
def get_state(self, metrics: Dict[str, float]) -> torch.Tensor:
    """Enhanced state representation with device consistency."""
    state = [...]  # Build state vector
    return torch.tensor(state, dtype=torch.float32, device=self.device)

def select_action(self, state: torch.Tensor, training: bool = True) -> int:
    """Enhanced action selection with device management."""
    # Ensure state is on correct device
    state = state.to(self.device)
    # ... rest of method
```

#### Model State Management
```python
def _save_model_state(self) -> Dict[str, torch.Tensor]:
    """Save model state with proper device handling."""
    return {k: v.clone().detach() for k, v in self.base_model.state_dict().items()}

def _restore_model_state(self, state_dict: Dict[str, torch.Tensor]):
    """Restore model state with device consistency."""
    device_state_dict = {}
    for k, v in state_dict.items():
        device_state_dict[k] = v.to(self.device)
    self.base_model.load_state_dict(device_state_dict)
```

### 2. Enhanced AttentionPolicyNetwork

#### Device-Aware Initialization
```python
class AttentionPolicyNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, ..., device: Optional[torch.device] = None):
        super().__init__()
        self.device = device or torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
        
        # ... create layers ...
        
        # Initialize weights and move to device
        self.apply(self._init_weights)
        self.to(self.device)
```

#### Device-Consistent Forward Pass
```python
def forward(self, state: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:
    # Ensure state is on correct device
    state = state.to(self.device)
    # ... rest of forward pass
```

### 3. Enhanced Operators with Device Management

#### ExpandWithMI Operator
```python
def _expand_layers(self, model: nn.Module, layers_to_expand: List[str]) -> nn.Module:
    """Add new layers with device management."""
    expanded_model = copy.deepcopy(model)
    
    # Get model device
    model_device = next(expanded_model.parameters()).device
    
    # ... create expanded blocks with device consistency ...
    
def _create_linear_expansion(self, layer: nn.Linear, device: torch.device) -> nn.Module:
    """Create expanded linear block with device consistency."""
    expansion_block = nn.Sequential(...)
    
    # Move to device and initialize new layers
    expansion_block.to(device)
    self._initialize_new_layers(expansion_block, device)
    
    return expansion_block
```

#### New Layer Initialization
```python
def _initialize_new_layers(self, module: nn.Module, device: torch.device):
    """Initialize new layers with proper device placement."""
    layers = list(module.children()) if isinstance(module, nn.Sequential) else [module]
    
    for i, layer in enumerate(layers):
        if isinstance(layer, (nn.Linear, nn.Conv2d)):
            if i == 0:  # Skip original layer
                continue
                
            # Initialize new layers
            if hasattr(layer, 'weight') and layer.weight is not None:
                torch.nn.init.kaiming_normal_(layer.weight, mode='fan_out', nonlinearity='relu')
            if hasattr(layer, 'bias') and layer.bias is not None:
                torch.nn.init.zeros_(layer.bias)
                
            # Ensure on correct device
            layer.to(device)
```

### 4. Device-Aware Operators

#### New Device-Aware Operators
```python
class DeviceAwareAttentionOperator(StructuralOperator):
    def __init__(self, device: torch.device):
        self.device = device
        
    def apply(self, model, metrics):
        device = metrics.get('device', self.device)
        # ... implementation with device consistency ...
```

### 5. Enhanced Experience Buffer

#### CPU Storage for Memory Efficiency
```python
def apply_tentative(self, ...):
    # ... create experience ...
    experience = Experience(
        state=state.cpu(),  # Store on CPU to save GPU memory
        action=action,
        reward=reward,
        next_state=next_state.cpu(),
        done=False,
        metrics_before=prev_metrics,
        metrics_after=new_metrics
    )
```

#### Device-Aware Policy Updates
```python
def _update_policy(self):
    """Update policy with device management."""
    # ... sample experiences ...
    
    # Move tensors to device
    states = torch.stack([exp.state.to(self.device) for exp in experiences])
    actions = torch.tensor([exp.action for exp in experiences], dtype=torch.long, device=self.device)
    rewards = torch.tensor([exp.reward for exp in experiences], dtype=torch.float32, device=self.device)
    next_states = torch.stack([exp.next_state.to(self.device) for exp in experiences])
```

### 6. Enhanced Trainer Integration

#### Device Parameter Passing
```python
self.dynarch = DynamicArchitecture(
    self.wrapped_model, 
    self.neuro_exapt.struct_optimizer, 
    self.neuro_exapt.info_theory,
    device=self.device  # Pass device to DynamicArchitecture
)
```

## Error Handling Improvements

### 1. Comprehensive Exception Handling
```python
def _apply_action_safe(self, action: int) -> Tuple[bool, Dict]:
    """Apply action with comprehensive error handling."""
    try:
        # ... apply action ...
        return True, {...}
    except Exception as e:
        return False, {'error': f"Action failed: {str(e)}"}
```

### 2. Robust Evaluation
```python
def evaluate(self, loader) -> Dict:
    """Enhanced evaluation with device management."""
    # ... setup ...
    
    with torch.no_grad():
        for batch_idx, batch_data in enumerate(loader):
            # Handle different loader formats
            if isinstance(batch_data, (list, tuple)) and len(batch_data) == 2:
                data, target = batch_data
                data, target = data.to(self.device), target.to(self.device)
            else:
                continue
                
            try:
                output = self.base_model(data)
                # ... process output ...
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Evaluation batch failed: {e}")
                continue
```

## Testing and Validation

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Device consistency across all components
- ✅ State tensor device placement
- ✅ Experience buffer device management
- ✅ Model state save/restore with device consistency
- ✅ Policy network device placement
- ✅ Action selection with device-aware states

### Test Results
All tests pass, confirming that:
1. All neural networks are created on the correct device
2. State tensors are consistently placed on the GPU/CPU as expected
3. Experience buffer properly manages device placement
4. Model state save/restore maintains device consistency
5. Policy updates work with proper device management

## Performance Improvements

### 1. Memory Efficiency
- Experience buffer stores states on CPU to save GPU memory
- Only moves tensors to GPU when needed for computation

### 2. Device Optimization
- Explicit device specification eliminates unnecessary device transfers
- Consistent device placement reduces memory fragmentation

### 3. Error Resilience
- Comprehensive error handling prevents training crashes
- Graceful degradation when architecture modifications fail

## Usage Guidelines

### 1. Device Specification
Always specify the device when creating DynamicArchitecture:
```python
dynarch = DynamicArchitecture(
    base_model=model,
    evolution=evolution,
    ib=info_bottleneck,
    device=torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
)
```

### 2. State Management
State tensors are automatically managed, but ensure consistency:
```python
state = dynarch.get_state(metrics)  # Automatically on correct device
action = dynarch.select_action(state)  # Handles device internally
```

### 3. Error Monitoring
Monitor for device-related errors in logs:
```python
success, info = dynarch.apply_tentative(action, state, mini_loader)
if not success:
    print(f"Evolution failed: {info.get('error', 'Unknown error')}")
```

## Conclusion

These comprehensive fixes resolve all device placement and tensor consistency issues in the Neuro Exapt framework. The implementation ensures:

1. **Robustness**: All operations handle device placement correctly
2. **Efficiency**: Memory usage is optimized with CPU/GPU placement strategy
3. **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling prevents crashes
4. **Maintainability**: Clear device management patterns throughout the codebase

The fixes have been thoroughly tested and validated, ensuring stable operation across different hardware configurations (CPU-only, single GPU, multi-GPU).
